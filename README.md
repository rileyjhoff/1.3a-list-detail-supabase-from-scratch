## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1) **Look at the drawing and name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1) **Look at the drawing and imagine using the app. What _state_ do you need to track?**
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? (i.e., "we need div to display the results in")**
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How" (i.e., `resultsEl.textContent = newResults`)**
1) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change? Does any DOM update?**
1) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done. (Hint: console.log usually helps here.)**
1) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?

- Consider your data model.
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
  - What are the key/value pairs?
  - What arrays might you need?
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)

| User should be able to . . .                                                         |             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| Visit the deployed pages on GitHub pages, with link in the About section of the Github repo|        2 |


| Events                                                                                |             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| On load on the home page, see a list of `<thing>`s, fetched from supabase                               |        4 |
| On clicking a `<thing>`, user should be taken to that `<thing>`'s detail page.  | 2 |
| Detail page should get the id from the URL and use that id to fetch that `<thing>` from supabase.                                      |        2 |
| Detail page should show the user details about the `<thing>` with more details than on the list page|     2 |

| Functions                                                                                |             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| PURE: `render<Thing>Card(dog)` : return DOM node |2|
| PURE: `render<ThingDetail(dog)` : return DOM node |2|
| ASYNC: `fetch<Things>()` : return array of `<thing>`s from supabase |2|
| ASYNC: `fetch<Thing>(id)` : return single `<thing>` from supabase |2|

## Stretch goal ideas
- Sort `<thing>`s by their name.
- Add an input that lets the user filter `<thing>`s on the list page.
- Add additional UI that lets the user sort `<thing>`s on the list page by different properties.
- For practice, make a second supabase table with another `<thing>` and add a second list to the list page. If you did <candies>, now do <candy-shops>, for example. Then, make a separate detail page for just that `<thing>`. Keep all the features from the original app as well.
- If you're feeling ambitious, see if you can get it working so that when you click on an item, it deletes from supabase then re-renders the list
- If you're feeling EVEN MORE ambitious, see if you can figure out how to let users create a `<thing>` in supabase and render it to the page.
- If you are mega-ultra final-form ambitious: see if you can figure out letting a user update a thing from the detail page.


# HTML Setup

## List page
- divs to hold the single plants
  - each plant should be a link to its detail page (anchor tag)
- big div to hold the list of all plants

### Events
- on load
  - get plants from the database
  - display those plants (loop, render, and append)

### Detail page
- div to hold the plant details

### Events
- on load
  - figure out which plant to go fetch . . .
  - get THIS SINGLE plant from the database
  - display THIS SIGNLE plant (render, and append)

# Step Zero:
## Make a supabase table with a few rows based on the `<thing>` of your choosing :)
  - `<thing>`s should have at least 4 properties.
